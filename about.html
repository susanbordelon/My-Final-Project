        <label2>
            <p>
                Maddie B Kitchen came into existance through the cherished culinary traditions passed down to Maddie B by her dear
                grandmother, known as "MoMo", Marty Bordelon. These recipes, deeply rooted in Marty's Caddo Adai Indain heritage,
                have been closely guarded family heirlooms for generations.  Futhermore, Marty's marriage to a Cajun man from South
                Louisiana, who had a penchant for spiciness, led to the incorporation of zesty elements into these recipes to offer
                an array of distinct flavors.
            </p>

            <p>
                Driven by her passion for the water, Maddie B relocated to Galveston and established Maddie B Kitchen as a heartfelt
                tribute to her grandmother.  The restaurant's menu is an imaginative fusion of her grandmother's timeless recipes and
                Maddie B's profound love for seafood

                Following her high school graduation, Maddie B pursued her culinary education by enrolling at the Culinary Institute of America and the
                Auguste Escoffier School of Culinary Arts, where she honed her expertise in the art of baking, pastries, and confections.
                Eager to expand her culinary repertoire, Maddie B embarked on a journey across the Atlantic to London, where she delved
                into the world of chocolate craftmanship, ultimately becoming a skilled chocolatier.

            <p>
                Driven by her deep affection for Galvestan Bay, Maddie B eventually returned home and realized her dream by establishing
                Maddie B Kitchen.  Here, she seamlessly combines her profound love for the bay with the cherished recipes passed down by
                her grandmother, creating a culinary experience to be shared with all.
